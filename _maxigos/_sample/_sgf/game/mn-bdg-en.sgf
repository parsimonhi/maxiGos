(;B[nr]LB[pr:A]C[13 : it's a joseki to get points in the corner. Go Seigen loves this sequence, which exists from the 17th century (if memory serves me correctly). Black at A is also possible.];W[mr];B[pr];W[ns];B[qq];W[mo]LB[qm:B][np:A]C[18 : usually, White plays tenuki or A. I tested this move, prefered by Fujisawa Shuko (he played it several times, for instance during game #1 of the 1st Kisei against Hashimoto Utaro). It aims to B.];B[qf];W[qm]LB[nc:C][pm:A][fq:B]C[20 : I didn't know what to answser in the north-east corner so I started by playing here, but the result is not good for White. C should be better.

**Question**

(;B[gd]LB[ie:A]C[53 : bad, Black must go out at A. The ponnuki is too big.];W[ie];B[gc];W[dc]C[Black splits White but there is still some aji in the corner.];B[fd]
